## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Receive an error message when the `form` is submitted if:
  - Any `input` field is empty. The message for this error should say *"[Field Name] cannot be empty"*
  - The email address is not formatted correctly (i.e. a correct email address should have this structure: `name@host.tld`). The message for this error should say *"Looks like this is not an email"*

## My process
- I made a container which had two divs. One div is for the content and other one is for the signup form.
- Gave classes and created a style.css file
- I used JavaScript and created a script.js file for the form validation
- used media query to make it mobile friendly and responsive

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS 
- JavaScript
- Flexbox


**Note: These are just examples. Delete this note and replace the list above with your own choices**

### What I learned
I learned many things about html, css and javascript. I leearned for can I make my website/webpage responsive. And how to do a form validation

### Continued development

In future projects i want to focus more on the CSS and javascript. There are some concepts I am still not completely comfortable with.
